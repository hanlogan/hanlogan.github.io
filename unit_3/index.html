	<h1>Honey Hi</h1>
	
	<p>Everyone should feel good more often</p>
	
	<p>Honey Hi’s goal is to bring more of these good-feelings to the Echo Park community. We have created a seamless experience that draws on nutrition, natural medicine, and progressive culinary ideas without a sense of fanaticism. This is not a "vegan” or “paleo” place. This is a common place that anyone can come to find food that tastes and feels good.</p> 

	<p>We offer:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Cold pressed juice</li>
		<li>Inventive smoothies</li>
		<li>Traditional bone broths</li>
		<li>Delicious soups</li>
		<li>Seasonal salads</li>
	</ul>
