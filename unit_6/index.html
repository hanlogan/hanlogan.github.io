          <p>Honey Hi's goal is to bring more of these good-feelings to the Echo Park community. We have created a seamless experience that draws on nutrition, natural medicine, and progressive culinary ideas without a sense of fanaticism. This is not a
            vegan or paleo place. This is a common place that anyone can come to find food that tastes and feels good.</p>
